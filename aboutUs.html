            <p>Founded in the year 2020, Silver-Works began as a small, ambitious venture led by a group of tech enthusiasts who shared a passion for innovation and problem-solving. What started in a modest workspace quickly evolved into a company with a global reach, driven by a relentless pursuit of excellence.
            <br>
            Our journey began with a visio to create technology solutions that simplify lives and empower businesses. In the early stages, we focused on offering custom software solutions to local businesses, earning trust
            through dedication and high-quality service.
            we took a leap into international markets, collaborating with clients across continents. With this growth came the opportunity to work on more challenging projects, including integrating AI and IoT into business models.
